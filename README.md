## Conformance Test Suite - GML Documents

### Scope

This test suite validates the content of a GML 3.2 instance document.

Visit the [project documentation website](http://opengeospatial.github.io/ets-gml32-data/) 
for more information, including the API documentation.

### How to run the tests
The test suite is built using [Apache Maven v3](https://maven.apache.org/). The options 
for running the suite are summarized below.

#### 1. Integrated development environment (IDE)

Use a Java IDE such as Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ. Clone the repository and build the project.

Set the main class to run: `org.opengis.cite.gml32.data.TestNGController`

Arguments: The first argument must refer to an XML properties file containing the 
required test run arguments. If not specified, the default location at `$
{user.home}/test-run-props.xml` will be used.
   
You can modify the sample file in `src/main/config/test-run-props.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties version="1.0">
  <comment>Test run arguments</comment>
  <entry key="iut">http://schemas.geosciml.org/geosciml/4.0/examples/GSML4-Borehole.xml</entry>
</properties>
```

The TestNG results file (`testng-results.xml`) will be written to a subdirectory
in `${user.home}/testng/` having a UUID value as its name.

#### 2. Command shell (console)

One of the build artifacts is an "all-in-one" JAR file that includes the test 
suite and all of its dependencies; this makes it very easy to execute the test 
suite in a command shell:

`java -jar ets-gml32-data-0.1-SNAPSHOT-aio.jar [-o|--outputDir $TMPDIR] [test-run-props.xml]`

#### 3. OGC test harness

Use [TEAM Engine](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine), the official OGC test harness.
The latest test suite release are usually available at the [beta testing facility](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/). 
You can also [build and deploy](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine) the test 
harness yourself and use a local installation.


### How to contribute

If you would like to get involved, you can:

* [Report an issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-cat30/issues) such as a defect or 
an enhancement request
* Help to resolve an [open issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-cat30/issues?q=is%3Aopen)
* Fix a bug: Fork the repository, apply the fix, and create a pull request
* Add new tests: Fork the repository, implement and verify the tests on a new topic branch, 
and create a pull request (don't forget to periodically rebase long-lived branches so 
there are no extraneous conflicts)
